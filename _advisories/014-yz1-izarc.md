CVE-2020-24175: yz1: stack overflow
===================================

Introduction
------------

I recently ran into an old-school buffer overflow while fuzzing the
[Yz1][0] archive (de)compression library.

The intention with this write-up is to go from a crash to code execution
in one of the archive software that bundles the `Yz1` library -- namely,
[IZArc][2] version `4.4`.  The target platform is Windows 10 64bit
(although both `IZArc` and `Yz1` are 32bit-only).

The analysis is made with [Ghidra][6] coupled with the [PHAROS
OOAnalyzer][7] plugin.

The image base for `Yz1.dll` in our analysis is `0x10000000` and the
version is 0.30 (as is shipped with `IZArc`, but newer versions of `Yz1`
are also vulnerable).


The Yz1 library
---------------

`Yz1` is an archaic compression format developed by YAMAZAKI at Binary
Technology.  It was part of their [DeepFreezer][1] archiver software.

Both of these components are closed-source and proprietary.  However,
`Yz1` is distributed as a shareware binary-only DLL and it's bundled
with a few modern file archivers -- including [IZArc][2], [ZipGenius][3]
and [Explzh][9].

The interface for `Yz1` is somewhat interesting.  There are a few
standalone functions that tries to verify that an archive is valid.
There are also functions for retrieving filenames and their metadata in
an archive.  File (de)compression is performed by a single public
function named [Yz1][4]:

```c
int WINAPI Yz1(const HWND wnd, LPCSTR cmd, LPSTR buf, const DWORD siz);
```

Every argument other than [cmd][5] can be `NULL` or `0` for window-less
use where no feedback is to be received from the module itself.

The [cmd][5] argument specifies what operation to perform and with what
options.  Some of these options include:

```sh
c       - Create archive
x       - Expand archive
-cN     - Check timestamp according to N
-iN     - Silnce status output according to N
```

This makes working with the `Yz1` API kind of like working with the
command-line interfaces for traditional (un)archivers like `tar` or
`zip`.

As mentioned, the focus in this write-up is on [IZArc][2] and its use of
the `Yz1` library.  The functionality in `Yz1` that we'll pay attention
to is the functionality that's used by `IZArc`.


The Yz1 header
--------------

The (for this write up) first relevant entrypoint, before the `Yz1()`
function is reached, is `Yz1CheckArchive()`.  `IZArc` uses this function
to validate `Yz1` archives before processing them.

The prototype looks like [this][4]:

```c
BOOL WINAPI Yz1CheckArchive(LPCSTR filename, const int mode);
```

The first argument is the filename of the archive to check.  The second
argument is the mode to check.  There are a number of checking modes
defined in [Yz1.h][10]:

```c
CHECKARCHIVE_BASIC 1
[...]
CHECKARCHIVE_ALL 16
```

`Yz1CheckArchive` returns `true` or `false` for all modes except
`CHECKARCHIVE_ALL`.  A mode of `CHECKARCHIVE_ALL` introduces other
possible return values, despite the function signature.

Our target program, `IZArc`, seem to always invoke `Yz1CheckArchive`
with a mode of `CHECKARCHIVE_BASIC`, so the other modes are ignored.

The `Yz1CheckArchive()` function, as well as the generic `Yz()` function
(during decompression), takes us to a class method with the following
signature:

```cpp
int __thiscall YzFile_DecodeHeader(yzFileDecode *this, char *x_path);
```

This method is far too complex to distill in its entirety, but it
performs a number of noteworthy operations.  First off, it starts by
reading a `0x14` byte header from the input file:

```c
/*
 * 1000e7b7
 */
x_size = _fread(&x_header,1,0x14,x_yz1File->fp);
```

For example, with an archive containing the following three files:

```python
>>> from pathlib import Path
>>> for p in Path().glob("*.txt"):
...     print(f"{p}: {p.stat().st_size:#x} bytes")
...
aaaa.txt: 0x25 bytes
bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb.txt: 0x1d bytes
cccccccccccccccccccc.txt: 0x21 bytes
```

The header will look something like this:

```sh
$ hexdump -e '4/1 "%02X" "\n"' demo.yz1
# 0: Archive magic (yz01)
797A3031
# 1: Flags; used to, e.g., indicate whether the archive is password-protected.
30363030
# 2. ???
000000B2
# 3. Number of bytes required to decode the filenames.
#
#    > file_count * sizeof(DWORD) * 2 * len(all_filenames_incl_NUL)
#
#    In our example, that is:
#
#    > 3*4*2 + len("aaaa.txt\0bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb.txt\0cccccccccccccccccccc.txt\0")
0000004F
# 4. File count
00000003
```

The reason for the two additional DWORDs per file in the third header
field is for metadata, as can be seen when
`yzFileDecode::YzFile_DecodeHeader` allocates and decodes the filenames
into a chunk of that size:

```sh
# _malloc(this->x_totalFilenameSize)
0:000> bu YZ1!yzFileDecode::YzFile_DecodeHeader + 0x56b
0:000> g

```

In the last memory display, we see that the first three DWORDs
correspond with the file sizes in big-endian (0x25, 0x1d, 0x21).  After
that are three DWORDs that I'm too lazy to figure out what they mean
(yes, there really are three -- notice that the file named `aaaa.txt`
has 4 0x61).  And finally are the NUL-separated filenames.

This chunk of memory is then processed in a method with the following
signature:

```cpp
yzDecHead *__thiscall yzDecHead(yzDecHead *this,
                                uchar *x_filenames,   /* chunk dumped above */
                                long *x_fileCount,    /* 0x3 */
                                yzFileEv *x_yzFileEv,
                                long *x_filenameSize, /* 0x4f */
                                bool *x_success);
```

The bounds for each filename is retrieved with the following C-ish code:

```c
/*
 * 0x1000d2fd
 */
DVar8 = *x_fileCount;
[...]
if ((uint)*x_filenameSize < DVar8 * 0xc) {
    [...]
} else {
    x_fileCount = (long *)(x_filenames + DVar8 * 8); /* adjust for metadata */
    [...]
    uVar9 = 0;
    plVar7 = x_fileCount;
    while ((plVar7 < x_filenames + *x_filenameSize &&
           (*(uchar *)plVar7 != '\0'))) {
      plVar7 = (long *)((int)plVar7 + 1);
      uVar9 = uVar9 + 1;
    }
[...]
```

With our example archive, `*x_fileCount` is 3 and `*x_filenameSize` is
0x4f.  The reuse of `x_fileCount` in the decompilation looks weird, but
`x_filenames + DVar8 * 8` adjusts for the initial `x_fileCount *
sizeof(DWORD) * 2` of metadata in the `x_filenames` buffer.

As can be seen, it doesn't matter how long any of the filenames are, so
long as a NUL-byte is encountered somewhere in the `x_filenames` chunk
(otherwise we'd run into an out-of-bounds read).

Even so, `Yz1` operates under the assumption that filenames are limited
to `FNAME_MAX32` bytes.  From the publically available [Yz1.h][10]:

```c
#if !defined(FNAME_MAX32)
#define FNAME_MAX32 512
#define FNAME_MAX   FNAME_MAX32
#else
#if !defined(FNAME_MAX)
#define FNAME_MAX   128
#endif
#endif
```

After `yzFileDecode::YzFile_DecodeHeader` and `yzDecHead::yzDecHead` has
decoded and processed the header and filenames, the filenames are stored
with their actual lengths for later use.  This information is used when
extracting the archive and/or listing its files with this exported
structure and these functions:

```c
typedef struct {
    DWORD   dwOriginalSize;
    DWORD   dwCompressedSize;
    DWORD   dwCRC;
    UINT    uFlag;
    UINT    uOSType;
    WORD    wRatio;
    WORD    wDate;
    WORD    wTime;
    char    szFileName[FNAME_MAX32 + 1];
    char    dummy1[3];
    char    szAttribute[8];
    char    szMode[8];
} INDIVIDUALINFO, FAR *LPINDIVIDUALINFO;

int Yz1FindFirst(HARC x_harc, LPCSTR x_pattern, LPINDIVIDUALINFO x_dst);
int Yz1FindNext(HARC x_harc, LPINDIVIDUALINFO x_dst);
```

Both of these functions invoke a method starting at `0x10002de0` that
enforce the `FNAME_MAX32` (512/0x200) byte limit (sorry for the lack of
cleanup!):

```c
[...]
/*
 * LAB_10002f17
 */
if (*(uint *)(*(int *)(iVar3 + 0x10) + 0x14 + uVar2 * 0x1c) < 0x200) {
    iVar3 = x_getPathInstance((cls_10002bc0 *)
                              (*(int *)(this->mbr_34 + 4) + 0xc),this->mbr_48);
    /*
     * NOTE: This is not important right now, but it will matter during
     * exploitation.  Filenames shorter than 0x10 bytes are stored
     * inline at iVar3 + 4.  Filenames GTE 0x10 are allocated a separate
     * buffer whose address is stored at iVar3 + 4.
     */
    if (*(uint *)(iVar3 + 0x18) < 0x10) {
        x_filenameSrc = (char *)(iVar3 + 4);
    }
    else {
        x_filenameSrc = *(char **)(iVar3 + 4);
    }
    x_filenameDst = x_dst->szFileName;
    do {
        x_chr = *x_filenameSrc;
        *x_filenameDst = x_chr;
        x_filenameSrc = x_filenameSrc + 1;
        x_filenameDst = x_filenameDst + 1;
    } while (x_chr != '\0');
}
else {
    /*
     * x_dst->szFileName = "too_long_file_name\0"
     */
    *(undefined4 *)x_dst->szFileName = 0x5f6f6f74;          /* _oot */
    *(undefined4 *)(x_dst->szFileName + 4) = 0x676e6f6c;    /* gnol */
    *(undefined4 *)(x_dst->szFileName + 8) = 0x6c69665f;    /* lif_ */
    *(undefined4 *)(x_dst->szFileName + 0xc) = 0x616e5f65;  /* an_e */
    *(undefined2 *)(x_dst->szFileName + 0x10) = 0x656d;     /* em */
    x_dst->szFileName[0x12] = '\0';
}
[...]
```


A stack-based buffer overflow
-----------------------------

Not all code paths pay attention to the recorded lengths of the
filenames.  The one my fuzzer ran into is a function that starts at
`0x10005080`.  It `sprintf(..., "expanding %s", ...)` with the file
currently being extracted for a logging message.

It's kind of interesting too, because -- similar to the snippet above --
the call to `sprintf()` also checks whether the filename is inline (that
is, if its length is below 0x10).  But it doesn't check that the
filename is below `FNAME_MAX32`.

```c
/*
 * 100055b5
 */
if (this_00->mbr_18 < 0x10) {
    pDVar6 = &this_00->mbr_4;
}
else {
    pDVar6 = (DWORD *)this_00->mbr_4;
}
_sprintf(&local_264,"expanding %s",pDVar6)
```


Mo' bugs mo' problems
---------------------

In working to exploit the fuzzed bug in the last section, I ran into a
situation where we had written N bytes on the stack before the first
`[RJC]OP` gadget.  However, after the first gadget we could only write a
handful of subsequent gadgets.  Otherwise, we'd run into another bug
earlier in the extraction process.

Similar to the previous flaw, this flaw is caused by a stack overflow.
It happens in `yzFileDecode::DecodeFile`.  Ghidra produces a somewhat
wonky decompilation of this method, so the following C-ish code has been
rewritten for clarity (at the expense of not being an accurate
representation of its disassembly -- although the important locations
are commented):

```cpp
/*
 * 1000eec0
 */
int yzFileDecode::DecodeFile(char *param_1, int *param_2)
{
    int rc;
    int duplicateCount = 0;
    unsigned int i = 0;
    char buf[XXX];

    [...];

    /*
     * LAB_1000efa0
     */
    do {
        if (this->x_yzDecHead->filenames == NULL) {
            [...];
        }

        /*
         * 1000f170
         */
        _sprintf(buf, "%s%s", this->x_dirname,
                 this->x_yzDecHead->x_filename[4 + i * 0x1c]);

        rc = x_hasFile(buf);
        if (rc) {
            duplicateCount += 1;
        }
    } while (i < this->x_yzDecHead->x_fileCount); /* 1000f02e */

    [...];

    /*
     * 1000f036
     */
    if (duplicateCount > 0) {
        x_overwriteWarning();
    }

    [...];
}
```

In the snippet above, each filename in the archive is checked for
existence on disk.  If it already exist, a warning message *may be*
presented to the user (`Yz1` only shows GUI messages if it's been given
a `HWND`).

As with the previous bug, the call to `sprintf()` is unchecked.  If a
path in `1000f170` is large enough, we'll overflow the stack.

However, one major issue with this flaw is that the call to `sprintf()`
at `1000f170` prepends the extraction directory to the filename.  This
complicates exploitation.  It also makes it difficult to exploit the
first bug mentioned in this writeup because this bug could be triggered
earlier in the execution if the user chooses a long extraction
directory.

With that in mind, one positive aspect of this bug is that we can
overwrite `this->x_yzDecHead` and cause an invalid memory access in the
`do-while()` conditional.  This leads to quick control of execution if
we overwrite a SEH.  So this is the bug that's exploited in the PoC.


Sploitin' like its the 00s
--------------------------

There are two important aspects of the decoding process of the archive
header and its filenames:

1. As mentioned above, filenames are separated by their terminating
   NUL-byte in the initial processing.
2. The chunk referenced as `x_filenames` above will contain as much
   decoded data as is specified by the third DWORD in the archive header
   (excl. leading metadata).

As will be seen in the PoC, I haven't bothered reverse engineering and
reimplementing the (de|en)coding algorithm (presumably based on
Huffman).  However, it seems that the archive filenames and their
content are adjacent each other such that:

```
- filename_0
- filename_1
- filename_2
- ...
- content_of_filename_0
- content_of_filename_1
- content_of_filename_2
- ...
```

If we'd modify the third DWORD in the header (0x4F in the demonstrative
archive above) to a larger value, the buffer referenced as `x_filenames`
would not only contain the decoded filenames, but also (part of,
depending on the value) their decoded contents.

This means that we can use the `Yz1` library itself to write our exploit
for the unchecked calls to `sprintf()`.  The general approach looks
like:

1. Create an archive with N files.
2. Set a breakpoint *before* the filenames are encoded, but *after* the
   metadata has been constructed.
3. Remove the terminating NUL-byte for one of the filenames (effectively
   concatenating them).
4. Let the process finish.
5. Increase the third DWORD in the header to a size that includes the
   length of all file content.

The result is that the decoding process will interpret file contents as
filenames.  This gives us ample opportunity to create a source buffer
large enough to overflow the stack in the call to `sprintf()`.

The PoC creation is accomplished with [pykd][8] -- which is not only a
plugin for `WinDbg` but also very usable as a standalone Python module
for automated debugging.

As for exploit mitigations, the changelog for `IZArc` mentions that ASLR
and DEP was introduced in `IZArc` version 4.3.  However, that only
applies to the main executable and *some* plugins (presumably the
plugins for which the author has access to the source code).

With that said, only two of the shipped modules are non-rebased:
`Tar32.dll` and `cabinet5.dll`.

Anyway, after having removed the `NUL` between two filenames in the
archive, the file contents that will later be interpreted as a filename
will contain the following:

1. Enough data to overflow the stack (incl. SEH).
2. A SEH gadget that adjusts `esp` and returns into our ROP sled.
3. Gadgets that prepares the stack with appropriate arguments for
   `VirtualAlloc()`
4. Gadget to invoke `VirtualAlloc()` by using its IAT slot in
   `Tar32.dll`.
5. Our shellcode.

Unfortunately, it's difficult to write a reliable exploit due to the
extraction directory being prepended to our overflowing "filename".  The
approach taken in the PoC is to spray the SEH overwrite after adjusting
the initial bogus data in an attempt for the overwrite to land on an
appropriate DWORD boundary.  The alignment is done in the interval
`[0,4)` -- i.e. `len(path) % 4` (where `path` includes the trailing
`\`).  So, there's a 1 in 4 shot for success if the extraction path is
unpredictable.


Demonstration
-------------

Because the PoC uses `Yz1.dll` and `pykd` to create the payload, and
because `Yz1.dll` is a 32-bit Windows-only module, the payload has to be
created on a Windows system with a 32-bit Python >=3.6.

Example:

```sh
> "C:\Program Files (x86)\Python38\python.exe" exploit.py   \
    --dll "C:\Program Files (x86)\IZArc\Yz1.dll"            \
    --output C:\Users\user\Downloads\archive.yz1            \
    --align C:\Users\user\Downloads\archive
=> created: C:\Users\user\Downloads\archive.yz1
=> extraction path alignment: 0
```

Note that `--align` can also be an integer `[0, 4)` or left out
completely (in which case it's derived from the `--output` path).
